# Multi-Class CNN Animal Classifier

### Description:
This repository contains code for a project that classifies images of 15 different animal species using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The project utilizes a dataset comprising 378,413 image files, meticulously categorized into 15 classes. The code is written in Python and employs TensorFlow and Keras libraries for model development and training.

### Dataset:
The dataset consists of a vast collection of images belonging to 15 distinct animal species. It includes original training data, augmented training data, and separate testing data for evaluation purposes.

### Model Architecture:
The CNN model architecture is based on the VGG16 model, a renowned deep convolutional neural network developed by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford. The model is fine-tuned to accommodate the specific requirements of the animal classification task.



### Training:
The model is trained using both original and augmented training data to enhance performance and generalization. Early stopping and learning rate scheduling techniques are employed to optimize training efficiency and prevent overfitting.
